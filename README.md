# UTF8Buffer
Simple library to work with UTF-8 text

---

# Design Objectives
UTF-8 is pretty much a requirement when it comes to internationalization. My uses for this library is so that I able to work with foreign and untrusted text sources.

As of this writing it only maintains the following features:

- Load a text file and sanatize it.
- Search and extract substrings from the buffer.

I do plan to adding support for simple text editing but its not yet implement
